# Installation

Getting the Community Plugin installed is your first step to get started. You will need to install the Community Plugin on your Encompass instance and in order to do so **you will need access to the Encompass Input Form Builder.**

## Installing from Basecamp :tent:

If you are a member of the Basecamp group, you can install the Community Plugin from the [install files uploaded to BaseCamp](https://3.basecamp.com/4747351/buckets/17942696/uploads/3398838157). If you are not currently a member of Basecamp and would like to join, please contact [Zack Sharkey](mailto:https://sharkeybyte.com/product/community-basecamp-tshirt-design1/zachary@sharkeybyte.com). The Community Basecamp is a free community driven collaboration portal for Encompass administrators, vendors, and stakeholders with a warm and welcoming user base focused on helping those in the broader Encompass commmunity/ecosystem.

## Installing Outside Basecamp

It is recommended that you install from Basecamp as that will be much more straightforward. However, for those that want to develop or extend the Community Project or build from source, instructions are available in the [developer documentation installation](/docs/development/installation) guide.

## Usage

Refer to the [Community Plugin Access Settings](/docs/documentation/tools/Administration/Plugin%20Management) for more information on how to configure access the Community Plugin.
