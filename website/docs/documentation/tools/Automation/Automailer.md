# Automailer

## Features

Automated emails with integrated reports straight from Encompass. With Automailer, you can setup reports to be delivered on an automated schedule to get your users and stakeholders the right information at the right time! :punch:

Automailer is capable of sending emails to multiple users at the same time and can even do this dynamically from a loan field that contains an email address. For example, you may want to send a specific report to all your loan officers on a regular basis. You only want them receive the information for their own loans though so they can focus on what is important to them. With Automailer, you can do exactly that by using a loan field containing the assigned loan officer's email address. 

:::caution

As the Automailer requires a user to be logged in for the automations to run, it might be best to have a dedicated user and machine for running automations.
