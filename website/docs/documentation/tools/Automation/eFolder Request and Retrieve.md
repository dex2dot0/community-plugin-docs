# Features

Automate requesting and retrieving eFolder documents through business rules. This tool utilizes the same process you'd normally use for document request and retrieval but allows for this to be performed in an automated way to help streamline your process and save your user's time! 

:::caution
If you are using a 3rd party service to request and retrieve documents, this tool may not work properly. This tool is designed to work with the standard Encompass eFolder request and retrieve processes and 3rd party services that override or change the standard functionality may cause this tool to not work properly.
