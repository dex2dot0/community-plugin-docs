# Pipeline Column Field IDs

## Features

If you have ever tried adding a column to your pipeline, you'd probably know that the only find option is based on the column name. This is the column name that you set in the reporting database in the Admin Tools.

Wouldn't it be convenient if you could also search by field ID? Of course it would! :rage:

That's why the Community Plugin offers this tool. It just makes sense and makes life easier for everyone! :heart:

## Setup

1. In Encompass
