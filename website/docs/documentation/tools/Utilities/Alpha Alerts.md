# Alpha Alerts

## Features

Alerts are give and take. Make it easier for your users to distinguish what is important and what to pay attention to by sorting alerts alphabetically. :abc:

## Setup

1. In Encompass, create a custom field called CX.ALERTS.ALPHA
   a. Field Type = Checkbox
2. If you want alerts to always be sorted alphabetically, set the custom field to "X". Otherwise you can set the field on a case by case basis using business logic such as a field trigger.
