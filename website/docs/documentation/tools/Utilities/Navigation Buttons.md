5. Select BackAndForward from the Plugin menu
6. Enable All Access or configure more fine tuned access using either Personas or Users

## Usage

1. Once the tool has been enabled, enabled users can now:
   a. Navigate to an input form in Encompass
   b. Select the Back button to navigate to the previous form
2. Additionally, once a user has advanced through multiple forms, if they select the back button to go to the previous form, the forward button will be enabled to allow the user to advance to form they were previously viewing prior to selecting the back button.
