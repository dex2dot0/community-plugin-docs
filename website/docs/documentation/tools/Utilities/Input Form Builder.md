5. Select InputFormBuilder as the plugin
6. Enable All Access or configure more fine tuned access using either Personas or Users. The users you enable will be those that will be able to access the IFB directly in Encompass. 

## Usage

1. After you have setup a user with access, make sure the user logs out and back in to Encompass in order to have the changes take effect. 
2. In Encompass, the Input Form Builder will load and be available as a new Encompass tab along the tab menu. Once the tab is clicked, the Input Form Builder will load directly in to Encompass:
