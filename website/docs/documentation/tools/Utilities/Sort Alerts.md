# Sort Alerts

## Features

Alerts are give and take. Make it easier for your users to distinguish what is important and what to pay attention to by sorting alerts alphabetically. :abc:

## Setup

**Zach - unclear how to enable. I enabled but alerts are not sorting alphabetically. Also how do I enable this at a broader scale, with personas?**

## Usage

1. Once the alert sorting capability is enabled:
   a. When a user opens a loan
   b. Alerts should be sorted and displayed in an alphabetic manner
