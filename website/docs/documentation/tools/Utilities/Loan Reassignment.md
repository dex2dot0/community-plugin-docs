**Clarification Needed** Zach I tried re-assigning myself as the Processor for a loan while I don't have the Processor persona and it didn't stop me but it definitely didn't work. It also appears to let me re-assign to roles that aren't actually tied to the loan either to a milestone or milestone-free role. For example, I have the Disclosures persona and tried re-assigning myself to the Disclosures role for a loan and it didn't have any issues. However, we do not have the Disclosures role tied to the loan in any way. Additionally, even when I do have the persona and I am re-assigning to a role that is connected to the loan it still does not seem to work. For example, I've got the processor persona. I tried re-assigning myself as the Jr. Processor (milestone free role) which should include user that have Processor & Jr. Processor personas. Upon using the re-assignment tool, the original person is still assigned as the Jr. Processor for the loan.
