5. The loan will open in a read-only capacity and you can make edits free of worry of affecting the loan file. **Some services** may not be available since you do not have edit rights to the loan.
6. If you try and save the loan, you should see a popup message like the following:

![No Saving Allowed](/img/ReadOnly/SaveRestricted.png)

7. Upon exiting the loan, the user will get a popup notifying them that their changes will not be saved:
