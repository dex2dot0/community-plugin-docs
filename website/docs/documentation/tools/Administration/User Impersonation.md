# User Impersonation

## Features

Test, test, and test some more. Tired of logging in under multiple accounts to follow this practice? The user impersonation feature for the Community Plugin was created to make testing as other users a whole lot easier. With this tool, you can now impersonate any user that falls below you in the organization hierarchy.

That's huge! :raised_hands:

5. A new menu will popup. **If the menu does not popup, check and make sure it is not already active. This is also true when trying to revise the impersonation settings.**

9. You can now act as if you are this user in Encompass. Depending on where you are in Encompass (Pipeline View, Editing a Loan, Reports, etc.) your experience may differ when the changes apply.
10. Once you have completed your testing and want to return to your normal permissions, repeat steps 1-4 above and click on the Return to Myself button:
