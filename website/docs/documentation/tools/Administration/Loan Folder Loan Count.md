2. Click on the Settings Menu
3. Expand the Community Menu

4. Expand the Loan Setup menu
5. Select the Loan Folders menu option
6. In the Loan Folders panel you should now see a count column appear. It might take a second or two for the number to populate but it will begin populating to provide a count of all the loans that are currently housed in that loan folder:
