# Settings Grid Search

## Features

If you have lots of Encompass settings, you may have always wished for a way to search for what you are looking for rather than having to track down something with sorting and scrolling. Field triggers for example, if you only have a few then things aren't so bad but when you have hundreds, it gets harder and harder to quickly find what you are looking for. The Settings Grid Search functionality from the Community Plugin helps you quickly find what you are looking for. Helping you stay more productive, more efficient, and more effective.

## Setup

1. In Encompass
2. Click on the Settings Menu
3. Expand the Community Menu
4. Click on PluginManagement

6. A search box should appear in the settings panel:

![Search Box](/img/GridSearch/SearchBox.png)

7. Typing in the search box will limit the results shown, for example:

![Searching](/img/GridSearch/Searching.png)

8. The search is not case-sensitive so searching for hmda in the same example above would still yield the same results. The search is intelligent so even in the same example above, if you typed 2018 or even 201, you'd still see the HMDA 2018 milestone completion rule show in the results.
9. :clock3: Saver! Every second counts.

### FYI

Other settings will also show the grid search option throughout the Encompass settings, it is not just limiting to the Business Rules settings. :rocket:
