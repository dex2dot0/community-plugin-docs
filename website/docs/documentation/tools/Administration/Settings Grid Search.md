# Settings Grid Search

## Features

If you have lots of Encompass settings, you may have always wished for a way to search for what you are looking for rather than having to track down something with sorting and scrolling. Field triggers for example, if you only have a few then things aren't so bad but when you have hundreds, it gets harder and harder to quickly find what you are looking for. The Settings Grid Search functionality from the Community Plugin helps you to quickly find what you are looking for.
