# Kick Everyone Out

## Features

It sounds harsh but what is really harsh is when users do not recieve the updates they need and things fall through the cracks. That is harsh for your borrowers, partners, and business and no one wants that.

With this tool, you can help eradicate those problems to ensure users are getting the most recent updates and aren't missing a beat!

Additionally, this tool will keep the auto-save entries directory clean by deleting those entries on each new Encompass login. 

This is a contribution based on source code from [Nikolai](https://encompdev.com/Products/ExitEncompassAt4AM) from EncompDev to kick every non super admin user out at 4AM and close Encompass. 

## Setup

1. In Encompass
2. Click on the Settings Menu
3. Expand the Community Menu
4. Click on PluginManagement

5. Select KickEveryoneOut as the plugin
6. Access will specify what users will be affected by the tool. All Access for example would kick all logged in users out of Encompass each day at 4AM. 


## Usage

**Note -** This tool does not apply to super administrators.

Once the tool has been properly configured, users will automatically start getting kicked out of the system at 4AM. The timing follows the user's system clock so 4AM will be based on what the user's system clock is set to. 

When the user logs back in to Encompass, the auto-save entries will be automatically deleted.
