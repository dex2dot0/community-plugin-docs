# Codebase Attachment

The Community Plugin has a base implementation for an easy way that you can attach codebase to your input forms using a single plugin rather than the traditional method of doing so in input form builder and attaching to each form directly. 

## Features

- [X] Share dependencies across your codebase assemblies. No more need to have each codebase split out in to a separate projects (though there are other solutions for this)
- [X] All your codebase assemblies in one project
- [X] Reduces manual uploads within the IFB for each codebase update

:::caution

This approach will not allow you to hook in to the form's event handlers. This is an important factor to consider when using this approach!
