# Installation

Getting the Community Plugin installed is your first step to get started. You will need to install the Community Plugin on your Encompass instance and in order to do so **you will need access to the Encompass Input Form Builder.** 

## Installing from Basecamp :tent:

If you are a member of the Basecamp group, you can install the Community Plugin from the [install files uploaded to BaseCamp](https://3.basecamp.com/4747351/buckets/17942696/uploads/3398838157). If you are not currently a member of Basecamp and would like to join, please contact [Zack Sharkey](mailto:https://sharkeybyte.com/product/community-basecamp-tshirt-design1/zachary@sharkeybyte.com). The Community Basecamp is a free community driven collaboration portal for Encompass administrators, vendors, and stakeholders with a warm and welcoming user base focused on helping those in the broader Encompass commmunity/ecosystem.

## Installing from GitHub

It is recommended that you install from Basecamp as that will be much more straight forward. However, if you would like to develop or extend the Community Plugin you will need to create your own installation file. To create an install file using the source code, you will need to:

1. Clone/download the Community Plugin [repository](https://github.com/zacksharkey/CommunityPlugin) from GitHub
2. Open the project in Visual Studio
3. Build the project to create a DLL file
